/**
 * Montierra (Johndorf Ventures Corporation) — the subdivision plan as data,
 * for the presentation at /johndorf/montierra (boss, 2026-10-04).
 *
 * Everything about blocks, lots, clusters and areas is read off the plan
 * drawing (public/johndorf/montierra-plan.jpg): lot numbers, which cluster
 * each run of lots belongs to, the lot areas printed on them, and the
 * facilities. The townhouse specs are as Johndorf published them at launch;
 * who has reserved or bought each lot is DEMO data (see lotBooking).
 *
 * Hotspot polygons are in the plan's 2000 × 1414 coordinate space (same
 * aspect as the image), so one SVG viewBox fits the picture at any size.
